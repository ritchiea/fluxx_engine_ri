Getting started with fluxx engine:

Get bundler running so you can manage your dependencies via the Gemfile 
* gem update --system
* gem install bundler
* 

* Be sure you are using rails 3
** Change your dependencies in the Gemfile
** If you are not using the bundler, you must install the latest rails: gem install rails --pre


fluxx_engine gem
* In order for the gem to be readable, you must place it in a directory ../fluxx_engine in relation to your directory.  Otherwise, amend the reference implementations Gemfile to reference its location.
* gem install jeweler to make sure you have jeweler available
* cd ../fluxx_engine; rake install
** Now you should see a fluxx_engine.gemspec file living in your fluxx_engine directory
* rails generate audited_migration
* generate the migration.  Note that this can be run multiple times without overwriting or generating extra migrations.  In the future to get upgrades, simply run it again
** rails generate fluxx_engine_migration
* generate the javascript and copy it to your application's public directory
** rails generate fluxx_engine_public

database
* cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
** Edit config/database.yml and adjust the parameters for your local db 
* rake db:setup

Get dependencies
* bundle install
